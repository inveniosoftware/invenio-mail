       Attachments do not work with Celery tasks since
       :class:`flask_mail.Attachment` is not serializable in ``JSON``
       nor ``msgpack``. Note that a
       `custom serializer <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/
       userguide/calling.html#serializers>`__
       can be created if attachments are really needed.

       This version adds attachments by putting them into a base64 encoded string.
       This is not an optimal solution, it might get problematic if they are too
       large to handle by the messaging queue, so check for a maximum size beforehand.
